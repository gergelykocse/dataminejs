why did  I need search instead of IndexOf? I thin it was the usage of pattenrs/wildcards et - search is for regular expressions

in below how to use wildcards etc? how to add levensthein distance ?

split the whole text to an array
split the keyword to an array
While indexof[keyword]/characters
loop  in text
if search(text) finds character1 check for character2 after it, then char 3 and so on if all matches, memorize the index of the beginning of the keyowrd
If no match , continue text with character1 again until the end

convert the index of an array(text) to indexing the actual text
and from there go with the logic from ''code1''
 
////
use RegExp.prototype[@@search]() - also uses  IndexOf     or    RegExp.prototype[@@matchAll]()
use more dynamic object elements
use const instead of let where possible
use object / functions for containing code in a nicer format
use button.addEventListener('click', () instead of ''onclick''
